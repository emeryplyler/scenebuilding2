Creating a scene in Unity. CMPM 121-1: Game Technologies

Emery Plyler

I have created a low-poly scene of a cloaked cat catching fish in the mountains. The scene includes only a few basic things; plants and hills make up the background, and the cat has a basket and a fishing rod to collect fish. There is also a simplistic house in the back to show that the cat lives here. When creating the fish, I was inspired by the fish from Hydroneer, which, while not a fishing-focused game, has some cute simplistic fish that come in a variety of colors. When creating my cat, I was inspired by many things including the cat person from Fatum Betula, the surreal PlayStation 1-styled game, and the main character from the upcoming Nine Sols, a cyberpunk Asian fantasy game. Other notable cat people from my childhood include Baron from The Cat Returns and Bast or Bastet from The Red Pyramid and The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. The main character of my scene is the cat, which is visible from every camera angle except first-person, which is from the cat's perspective.

I created all of my assets and didn't use any found online. The only assets that are Game Objects are the terrain and water. I also created the skybox texture.
The objects in my scene include:
1. The cat       (Created)
2. Fishing Pole  (Created)
3. Large Fish    (Created)
4. Small Fish    (Created)
5. Basket        (Created)
6. Poppy         (Created)
7. Cattail       (Created)
8. Tree          (Created)
9. House         (Created)
10. Terrain      (Created)

These together reach the maximum of 26 points.
